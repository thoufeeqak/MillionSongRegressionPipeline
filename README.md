# MillionSongRegressionPipeline

Developed an end-to-end linear regression pipeline to predict the release year of a song given a set of audio features. Implemented a gradient descent solver for linear regression, use Spark's machine Learning library (mllib) to train additional models, tune models via grid search, improve accuracy using quadratic features, and visualize various intermediate results to build intuition.
